Project management and governance repository.

## Codex

The [Codex](Codex/README.md) contains the foundational governance framework for Sovereign systems.

**Key Documents:**
- [Codex Index](Codex/README.md) - Overview and policy flags
- [Scaffolded Freedom v3](Codex/Articles/Scaffolded_Freedom_v3.md) - Core governance article
- [Pornography Prohibition](Codex/Articles/Pornography_Prohibition.md) - Content restrictions and recovery programs
- [Charter (One-Pager)](Codex/CHARTER.md) - External-facing summary
- [Grok Paste](Codex/GROK_PASTE.md) - Copy-paste ready content

**Policy Schema:**
- [JSON Enforcement Schema](Codex/Policies/Scaffolded_Freedom.json)

## Core Principles

1. Free will without discipline is illusion.
2. Control without transparency is tyranny.
3. True freedom requires scaffolding until strength is restored.
4. Prosperity uncapped honors the disciplined creator—no artificial scarcity, no elite throttle.

## Policy Flags

- `CONTENT.PORNOGRAPHY: PROHIBITED`
- `EARNINGS.CAPS: NONE`
