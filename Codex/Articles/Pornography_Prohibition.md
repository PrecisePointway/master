# Codex Article – Pornography Prohibition + Education & Recovery

## Law

Pornography is prohibited across all Sovereign infrastructure (apps, APIs, storage, indexes, model training data, and payment channels). In parallel, an Education & Recovery Program is offered free to all users and communities.

## Intent

We do not merely block; we transform—redirecting demand into literacy, healing, and healthier reward pathways.

## Definitions

**Pornography:** Material primarily intended to arouse via explicit sexual depiction or description of sexual acts, genital display, or fetishized violence.

**Narrow exceptions:** Medical/legal/educational contexts using non-explicit, age-appropriate depictions, vetted and logged.

## Program Pillars

### 2. Compulsive Use Reduction (Intervention)
