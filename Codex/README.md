# Codex Index

## Overview

The Codex is the foundational governance framework for Sovereign systems. It establishes principles, restrictions, scaffolds, and enforcement mechanisms to protect free will while enabling uncapped prosperity.

## Core Principles

1. **Free will without discipline is illusion**

3. **True freedom requires scaffolding until strength is restored**
4. **Prosperity uncapped honors the disciplined creator—no artificial scarcity, no elite throttle**
