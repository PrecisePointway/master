# Codex Charter on Scaffolded Freedom

**A governance framework for sovereign systems**

---

## Core Law

Free will is fragile and must be scaffolded until it matures into self-rule. Sovereign systems restrict destructive shortcuts while training citizens to self-govern. **No glass ceiling shall cap honest earnings:** prosperity flows uncapped, limited only by transparency and harm to none.

---

## Four Principles

1. **Free will without discipline is illusion.**
2. **Control without transparency is tyranny.**
3. **True freedom requires scaffolding until strength is restored.**
4. **Prosperity uncapped honors the disciplined creator—no artificial scarcity, no elite throttle.**

---

## Why This Matters

**Philosophy:** From Aristotle's weakness of will to Skinner's behavioral science, we know choice can be hijacked.

**Neuroscience:** Dopamine pathways override executive control; addiction fatigues the will.

**Economics:** Artificial ceilings suffocate innovation. Uncapped markets anchored in truth multiply communal wealth.

## What We Do

### Restrict Poisons
Ban content and platforms that hijack the will:
- Pornography (prohibited)
- Predatory gambling (blocked)
- Exploitative platforms (blocked)

### Build Scaffolds
Provide structure for recovery:
- Education modules on addiction, literacy, and healthy habits
- Healthier dopamine pathways and rituals
- Transition triggers based on maturity metrics

### Remove Ceilings
Enable uncapped prosperity:
- No quotas on honest earnings
- No elite gates or artificial scarcity
- Wealth from truth-aligned work scales freely
- Transparency and "harm none" are the only limits

---

## End State

**True freedom = self-rule.**  
**True prosperity = uncapped growth.**

The scaffolds protect until strength is restored, then withdraw. Citizens become sovereign creators, not chained consumers.

---

## Codex Seal

*"No chain binds the will, no ceiling caps the hand.*  
*Scaffolds rise to free, then fall as strength expands.*  
*Poisons banned, prosperity unchained—truth's uncapped command."*

---

## Policy Enforcement

- `CONTENT.PORNOGRAPHY: PROHIBITED`
- `EARNINGS.CAPS: NONE`

All restrictions are logged publicly. All metrics are transparent. All scaffolds are temporary.
