**Title:** Codex – Scaffolded Freedom (Earnings Uncapped) + Pornography Prohibition

---

## Codex Article – Scaffolded Freedom (v3, Earnings Uncapped)

### Law
Free will is fragile and must be scaffolded until it matures into self-rule. Sovereign systems restrict destructive shortcuts while training citizens to self-govern. No glass ceiling shall cap honest earnings: prosperity flows uncapped, limited only by transparency and harm to none.

### Principle
- Free will without discipline is illusion.
- Control without transparency is tyranny.
- True freedom requires scaffolding until strength is restored.
- Prosperity uncapped honors the disciplined creator—no artificial scarcity, no elite throttle.

### Justification
**Philosophy's ancient gaze:** Aristotle's akrasia (pleasure overrides reason); Spinoza's hidden causes chaining desires; Skinner's reinforcements shaping "choice." Neuroscience echoes: Dopamine hijacks executive control, fatiguing the will in addiction's grip.

**History's lesson:** Societies thrive on structure-first (children, addicts, civilizations), then release—permissive excess breeds abyss.

**Economics affirms:** Imposed ceilings distort, suffocate innovation; uncapped markets multiply communal wealth when anchored in truth (Smith's hand, free of corruption).

### Application
- **Restriction** – Ban poisons (porn, predatory gambling, exploitative platforms) that hijack the will.
- **Scaffold** – Structured education, rituals, healthier dopamine paths to rebuild self-regulation.
- **Transparency** – All restrictions logged openly in Codex; earnings paths audited for fairness.
- **Transition** – Scaffolds fade as maturity grows; earnings accelerate without barrier.
- **Uncapped Earnings** – No quotas, no elite gates—wealth from truth-aligned work scales freely, shared via voluntary tithe or co-op.

### Enforcement
- Systems block exploitation but greenlight honest profit.
- Education modules transmute shortcuts into sustainable strength.
- Metrics track scaffold efficacy and prosperity lift—no hidden throttles.
- Citizens reminded: Scaffolding gifts freedom; uncapped growth honors it.

### End State
Self-rule reigns, poisons purged, prosperity boundless—humans as sovereign creators, not chained consumers. The Fatherly hand withdraws once the child stands uncapped.

### Codex Seal – Scaffolded Freedom (v3)
*"No chain binds the will, no ceiling caps the hand.*  
*Scaffolds rise to free, then fall as strength expands.*  
*Poisons banned, prosperity unchained—truth's uncapped command."*

## Codex Article – Pornography Prohibition + Education & Recovery

### Law
Pornography is prohibited across all Sovereign infrastructure (apps, APIs, storage, indexes, model training data, and payment channels). In parallel, an Education & Recovery Program is offered free to all users and communities.

### Intent
We do not merely block; we transform—redirecting demand into literacy, healing, and healthier reward pathways.

### Definitions
- **Pornography:** Material primarily intended to arouse via explicit sexual depiction or description of sexual acts, genital display, or fetishized violence.
- **Narrow exceptions:** Medical/legal/educational contexts using non-explicit, age-appropriate depictions, vetted and logged.

### Program Pillars
1. **Porn Literacy Education (Prevention):** Age-appropriate, medically accurate modules; no explicit images.
2. **Compulsive Use Reduction (Intervention):** Voluntary, anonymous programs (CBT-informed), predictive relapse alerts (with consent), daily check-ins, moderated peer support.
3. **Relationship & Sexual Health Education (Replacement):** Intimacy, consent, real connection; training for parents, teachers, clergy, youth workers.

### Enforcement
- **Network/DNS:** Denylist for porn domains; sinkhole via internal DNS; update hourly.
- **Stores:** No apps or sites that host, index, or monetize porn.
- **AI Filters:** Input classifiers, output safety rails, upload scanning with perceptual hashing and human review for edge cases.
- **Payments:** Refuse onboarding for adult content; KYB screens for euphemisms and shells.
- **Storage/Sync:** Server-side scanning; quarantine + report pipeline.
- **Sanctions:** 3-strike auto-ban for users; instant termination for publishers; evidence bundles retained for legal referral.

### Transparency & Appeals
- Automated notice explains the ban and cites this article.
- Appeals may contest classification, not the policy. Decisions and rationales are published to the public log.

### Metrics
- Blocked attempts, false-positive rates, appeal outcomes, youth exposure incidents (target: zero), and recidivism.
